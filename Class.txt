1. **What is an ecosystem?**  
   An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.

2. **What are biotic components?**  
   Biotic components are living things like plants, animals, and microorganisms in an ecosystem.

3. **What are abiotic components?**  
   Abiotic components are non-living things like air, water, sunlight, and soil in an ecosystem.

4. **What is a food chain?**  
   A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism to another in a sequence.

5. **What is a food web?**  
   A food web is a network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.

6. **What are trophic levels?**  
   Trophic levels are the positions organisms occupy in a food chain, like producers or consumers.

7. **Who are producers?**  
   Producers are organisms like plants that make their own food through photosynthesis.

8. **Who are consumers?**  
   Consumers are organisms that eat other organisms for energy, like animals.

9. **Who are decomposers?**  
   Decomposers are organisms like bacteria and fungi that break down dead matter.

10. **What is the 10% energy rule?**  
   Only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next; the rest is lost.

11. **What is biomagnification?**  
   Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of harmful substances in organisms at higher trophic levels.

12. **What are biodegradable substances?**  
   Biodegradable substances can be broken down naturally by decomposers, like food waste.

13. **What are non-biodegradable substances?**  
   Non-biodegradable substances cannot be broken down naturally, like plastic.

14. **Why is ozone layer important?**  
   The ozone layer protects Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.

15. **What causes ozone depletion?**  
   Ozone depletion is caused by chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) released into the atmosphere.

16. **What is garbage management?**  
   Garbage management involves proper disposal, recycling, and reduction of waste to protect the environment.

17. **Why is plastic harmful to the environment?**  
   Plastic is non-biodegradable, pollutes soil and water, and harms wildlife.

18. **What is the role of decomposers in an ecosystem?**  
   Decomposers recycle nutrients by breaking down dead organisms, maintaining soil fertility.

19. **How do human activities affect the environment?**  
   Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and industrialization harm ecosystems and biodiversity.

20. **What is sustainable development?**  
   Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising resources for future generations.
